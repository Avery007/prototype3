# prototype3
 An escape game.
The player is stuck in a building and he needs to find 4 balls to exit. By clicking on the balls they will be collected, and the player is able to move outside when he gets the fourth ball. Since it is just a prototype there is large space to change things. 
Design question: what functions should I add to enble the play to exit the building ?
Playtest question:
1. Is it easy to find the balls?
2. how do you feel about the mouse control? Is it convenient to use it look around and click on the balls?
3. Any bugs you encounter?
4. How do you feel about the environment? 
5. Optional question: Are there any other functions I can add to make the game more interesting?
